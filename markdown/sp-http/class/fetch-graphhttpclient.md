Generally, the parameters and semantics for HttpClient.fetch() are essentially the same as the WHATWG API standard that is documented here: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/ The GraphHttpClient subclass adds some additional behaviors that are convenient when working with SharePoint ODATA API's (which can be avoided by using HttpClient instead): - Default "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers are added if not explicitly specified.

**Signature:** _public fetch(url: string,
    configuration: [GraphHttpClientConfiguration](../../sp-http/class/graphhttpclientconfiguration.md),
    options: [IGraphHttpClientOptions](../../sp-http/interface/igraphhttpclientoptions.md)): [Promise](../../web-apis/class/promise.md)<GraphHttpClientResponse>;_

**Returns**: [`Promise`](../../web-apis/class/promise.md)<GraphHttpClientResponse>



a promise that will return the result
