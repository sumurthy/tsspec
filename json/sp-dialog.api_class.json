      "descr": "Constructor for the BaseDialog class. It is important to keep the constructor lightweight. Use onOpen() for doing heavy-weight initializations that are needed for rendering the dialog such as resource allocations and asynchronous calls to fetch data. You can use the constructor to set initial parameters of your dialog such as references to resources in your application. The reason for this is that dialogs are usually constructed upon a UI event e.g. a button click, but the dialog may not always be shown right after construction. Keeping the constructor lightweight ensures smooth user experience and avoids doing throw-away work in case the dialog is not shown later e.g. if the framework rejects it. Another benefit of doing this is avoiding memory leaks by doing all the allocations and disposals in symmetric onOpen() and onClose() events. If you allocate unmanaged resources in the constructor, you have a memory leak because there is no guarantee onClose() will get called, and onClose() is your only opportunity to dispose. Example: constructor(cacheReference: any) { super(); this._cache = cacheReference; // This is okay. Keeping a reference to my internal cache. this._cache.refresh(); // This is bad practice. // If you need to refresh the cache (or fetch data) for rendering, do it in onOpen() }",
